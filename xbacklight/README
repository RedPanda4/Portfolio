This is a project i adapt from:
https://gitlab.com/wavexx/acpilight/-/blob/master/xbacklight

From the need to tweak the way the value is calculate, since for most of controllers on my laptop made that low values (0 to 10) changed the brightness in a radical way, on high values (11-100) it wasn't notice any change.

i add my own that is inserted between the highlighted blocks
# ---------------------------- CODE ADDED -----------------------------
# -------------------------- END OF MY CODE ---------------------------
that is for the added controller and integration of the controller on the main code
